This is a port of kmyuhkyuk's GFL2 Character mod to Aki version 3.1.1. I have not tested for 3.2.0 and beyond

The same issue of the character skin glow in the dark like a CIA agent still persist in this version and is not fixed. 
Please contact the original author for this problem, I barely know what I am doing.

---Installation---
1. Decompress all 3 7z files, copy all folders to spt-aki\user\mods
2. Copy the VoiceAdder dll file to BepInEx\plugins
3. Start with a new profile, and your weeb shit is now in escape from tarkov, you absolute degenerate
